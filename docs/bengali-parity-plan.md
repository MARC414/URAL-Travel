## Why this exists

The site publishes in English and Bengali. Measured against the built output on
2026-10-14, the figures were:

| Page group | English body | Bengali body | Ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Home | 1,024 | 45 | 4% |
| /visa hub | 1,338 | 80 | 6% |
| /visa/nepal-visa | 923 | 169 | 18% |
| /flights hub | 1,152 | 91 | 8% |
| /hotels hub | 1,200 | 95 | 8% |
| /costs hub | 1,073 | 95 | 9% |
| /contact | 343 | 42 | 12% |
| /about | 724 | 55 | 8% |
| /visa-free-countries | 1,755 | 55 | 3% |
| /umrah | 773 | 636 | 82% |
| **Blog (median of 47)** | **965** | **625** | **65%** |

So the problem is **not** the blog — that was already written properly, post by
post, and is the model to copy. The problem is every **hub and detail page**,
which ships a Bengali heading, one intro paragraph and a link list. Those pages
are not translations and must not be presented as such.

Two defers fed this:

- `DEFERRED_BN_GROUPS` in `src/utils/localeRoutes.ts` switches off `/destinations`
  entirely — 7 English routes with no Bengali twin at all.
- Everywhere else, the Bengali twin exists but is a shell.

## The standard this programme holds

A page is at **parity** when a Bengali reader gets the same facts, the same
figures, the same caveats and the same sourcing as an English reader — written
in Bengali for a Bengali reader, never machine-translated, never an English body
under a Bengali heading.

Where parity is not yet reached, the page must not claim it. The About page
claimed parity site-wide; that was false and was corrected in Unit 0.

## Tier 1 — full parity (a Bengali reader's real questions)

| Section | Routes | Units |
|---|---:|---|
| **A. Destinations** (hub + 6 guides) | 7 | A1–A8 |
| **B. Visa-free countries** (the flagship pillar) | 1 | B1–B2 |
| **C. Visa** (hub + 6 guides) | 7 | C1–C8 |
| **D. Costs** (hub + 6 guides) | 7 | D1–D8 |
| **E. Trust pages** (/about, /contact, /privacy) | 3 | E1–E3 |
| **F. Umrah** parity review (already 82%) | 1 | F1 |

## Tier 2 — honest summary level

These keep a summary, but the summary must be true and must say what it is.
No parity claim, no English body under a Bengali heading.

| Section | Routes |
|---|---:|
| G. Flights (hub + 6 routes) | 7 |
| H. Hotels (hub + 6 areas) | 7 |
| I. Home, /tools, /sitemap, /experiences, /blog hub | 5 |
| J. Blog — 1 missing override, 5 stale override keys | small |

## Section A — Destinations (ACTIVE)

The one fully-deferred section, and the top of the funnel for every trip.
Six countries: Nepal, Thailand, Malaysia, Dubai, Singapore, Maldives.

Per destination, writing required: `country`, `title`, `description`,
`bestTimeToVisit`, 4–5 itinerary days (day title + 3 activities each),
3 `localTransport` entries, `budgetBdt`, `quickAnswer`, 4 `keyFacts`, 5 `faqs`.
That is ~43 strings of real Bengali per destination, ~260 for the section.

| Unit | Deliverable | State |
|---|---|---|
| A0 | Recon: data shape, consumer chain, scale | ✅ done |
| A1 | `src/data/bengaliDestinations.ts` + `getLocalizedDestinations()` + client wiring | ✅ done |
| A2 | Nepal guide | ✅ done |
| A3 | Thailand guide | ☐ |
| A4 | Malaysia guide | ☐ |
| A5 | Dubai guide | ☐ |
| A6 | Singapore guide | ☐ |
| A7 | Maldives guide | ☐ |
| A8 | Prerender body branch — render the localized data as crawlable Bengali | ☐ |
| A9 | Lift the deferral + Bengali SERP copy for all 7 routes | ☐ |
| A10 | Verify: 92/92 routes, reciprocal hreflang, sitemap clusters, build checks | ☐ |

**Deferral lifts only at A9.** Removing `/destinations` from
`DEFERRED_BN_GROUPS` before all six guides are written would ship English-bodied
`bn-BD` pages — the exact failure the deferral was added to prevent.

## Recommended order after Section A

B first (the flagship page, highest external value), then C and D (highest
search volume for a Bengali reader), then E, F. Tier 2 last.

## Standing rules for every unit

1. **Facts, figures and caveats must match the English page exactly.** No
   softened claims, no dropped caveats, no invented numbers.
2. **BDT amounts stay in Latin digits** (`BDT 20,000`); durations, days and
   counts use Bengali digits (`৫ দিন`). This matches the existing house
   convention in `src/data/bengaliContent.ts`.
3. **Place names are transliterated** (`কাঠমান্ডু`, `পোখারা`), never left in
   Latin script inside Bengali prose. Airport and app names keep their Latin
   form (`KTM`, `Pathao`) because they are searched that way.
4. **No page claims parity until it has it.**
